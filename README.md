Homework 4

This assignment's goal is to further demonstrate the understanding of JavaScript and create a dynamic table
to use four different inputs for multiplication. The HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files are together in this repo.
Furthermore, a GitHub link is provided in the text file along with the PDF assignment. This time however, we will
be using the JQuery plugin and validation.
